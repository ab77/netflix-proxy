Bypasses [The Great Firewall](https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/issues/153#issuecomment-211442063) and works for blocked sites too, such as [PornHub](http://www.pornhub.com/). And if you happen to live in Germany and want to [watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_of_YouTube_videos_in_Germany) YouTube like the rest of the world does, just add `googlevideo.com` to `zones.override` file and run `docker restart bind`.\r\n\r\nThis solution will only work with devices supporting Server Name Indication (SNI)[n7] and only if they honour DNS settings. To test SNI, open a web browser on the device you are planning to watch content and go to [this](https://sni.velox.ch/) site (`https://sni.velox.ch/`).\r\n\r\n**Update July/2016**: Some providers bypass DNS completely when making media requests. If you are willing to pay for a service that unblocks these, please [vote](http://www.poll-maker.com/poll752414x73014Ca9-30).\r\n\r\n**Update June/2016**: HE TunnelBroker IPv6 endpoints are now also blocked. Your best bet now is to find a small VPS which offers native IPv6 support and which isn't yet blocked by Netflix (and keep it quiet :grimacing:). For other, non-IPv6 enabled services that honour DNS settings, this solution should still work fine.\r\n\r\n**Update March/2016**: IPv6 addresses of common hosting providers are now blocked in the same way as IPv4 (incl. Digital Ocean and Vultr). Netflix could be \"tagging\" accounts[n11]. Netflix and BBC iPlayer are also perfoming geo checks on their media hosts, so the relevant media domains are now proxied by default[n8]. Please note, that proxying media delivery could increase the bandwidth bill you get from your VPS provider. However, since most VPS providers offer 1TB per month inclusive with each server and most home ISPs don't offer anywhere near that amount, it should be a moot point in most situations.\r\n\r\nPlease see the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/wiki) page(s) for some common troubleshooting ideas.\r\n\r\n**Unblocked Netflix?** Great success!

If you prefer a video tutorial, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DrNgnq_cdM) is one prapared by one of the users. Note, OpenVZ **won't work**[n15], make sure to get a proper virtual machine using KVM or Xen. These instructions are based on the assumption, that access to the US region access is desired. If a different region is required (e.g. France), you may struggle with HE tunnel broker, as their entire network appears to be [geo-located](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo) in the US. Instead, you could try to find a small hosting provider in the desired region and install with native IPv6 (or even just IPv4) instead of tunnel. To do this, run the build normally, but omit all parameters to `build.sh`.\r\n\r\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/master/static/digitalocean.png)](https://m.do.co/c/937b01397c94)\r\n\r\n(Netflix is **blocked**) The following is based on a standard Ubuntu Docker image provided by `DigitalOcean`, but should in theory work on any Linux distribution **with** Docker pre-installed. ~~Do **not** enable native IPv6 on the host.~~\r\n\r\n1.

Head over to [Kamatera](https://www.kamatera.com/express/compute/?tcampaign=antonbelodedenko&HT=17) to start your **30 Day Free Trial**.\r\n2. Create a new server in a geographic location of interest using `Ubuntu Server 14.04 64-bit` OS image.\r\n3. SSH to your server and run: `apt-get update && apt-get -y install vim dnsutils curl sudo git && curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh && git clone https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy /opt/netflix-proxy && cd /opt/netflix-proxy && ./build.sh`\r\n4.

Login using `admin` account with the password you recorded during the build, in step 8 above. If you've forgottedn your admin credentials, [reset](https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/wiki/Changing-Admin-Password-For-Auth-Version).\r\n\r\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/master/static/admin.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/master/static/admin.png)\r\n\r\nThe `admin` account does not restrict the entry or removal of IPs. If you want to restrict the entry of IPs to the current client IP using an automatically populated drop-down, create a standard user account using the `account-creator.sh` script located in the `auth` directory, which will prompt you for the input and create the user account.\r\n\r\n#### Dynamic IPs\r\nYou can also use the `netflix-proxy` admin site to update your IP address, should your ISP assign you a new one (e.g. via DHCP). If your IP address does change, all HTTP/HTTPS requests will automatically be redirected to the admin site on port `8080`. All DNS requests will be redirected to `dnsmasq` instance running on port `5353`. You will most likely need to purge your browser and system DNS caches after this (e.g. `ipconfig /flushdns` and `chrome://net-internals/#dns`) and/or reboot the relevant devices. This mechanism should work on browsers, but will most likely cause errors on other devices, such as Apple TVs and smart TVs. If you Internet stops working all of a sudden, try loading a browser and going to `netflix.com`.\r\n\r\n#### Automatic IP Authorization\r\n**WARNING**: do not do enable this unless you know what you are doing.\r\n\r\nTo enable automatic authorization of every IP that hits your proxy, set `AUTO_AUTH = True` in `auth/settings.py` and run `service netflix-proxy-admin restart`. This setting will effectively authorize any IP hitting your proxy IP with a web browser for the first time, including bots, hackers, spammers, etc. Upon successful authorization, the browser will be redirected to [Google](http://google.com/).\r\n\r\nThe DNS service is configured with recursion turned on by [default](https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy#security), so after a successful authorization, anyone can use your VPS in DNS amplification attacks, which will probably put you in breach of contract with the VPS provider. You have been **WARNED**.\r\n\r\n### Security\r\nThe build script automatically configures the system with **DNS recursion turned on**. This has security implications, since it potentially opens your DNS server to a DNS amplification attack, a kind of a [DDoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack). This should not be a concern however, as long as the `iptables` firewall rules configured automatically by the build script for you remain in place. However if you ever decide to turn the firewall off, please be aware of this.\r\n\r\nIf you want to turn DNS recursion off, please be aware that you will need a mechanism to selectively send DNS requests for domains your DNS server knows about (i.e. netflix.com) to your VPS and send all of the other DNS traffic to your local ISP's DNS server. Something like [Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) can be used for this and some Internet routers even have it built in. In order to switch DNS recursion off, you will need to build your system using the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy /opt/netflix-proxy && cd /opt/netflix-proxy && ./build.sh -r 0 -b 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command Line Options\r\nThe following command line options can be optionaly passed to `build.sh` for additional control:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: ./build.sh [-r 0|1] [-b 0|1] [-c <ip>] [-z 0|1] [-u <username>] [-p <password>] [-k <update-key>] [-n <1..N>] [-s <subnet>]\r\n        -r      enable (1) or disable (0) DNS recursion (default: 1)\r\n        -b      grab docker images from repository (0) or build locally (1) (default: 0)\r\n        -c      specify client-ip instead of being taken from ssh_connection\r\n        -s      specify IPv6 subnet for Docker (e.g. 2001:470:abcd:123::/64)\r\n        -z      enable caching resolver (default: 0)\r\n        -u      HE tunnel broker username\r\n        -p      HE tunnel broker password\r\n        -k      HE tunnel broker update key\r\n        -n      HE tunnel index (default: 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other Cloud Providers\r\n\r\n### Locale Issues\r\n\r\nThe build script has been designed to work on `Ubuntu 14.x` and `Debian 8.x`. It will most likely fail on all other distributions. Some pre-requisites require the locale to be set correctly and some provider OS images need extra help. If you get `locale` issues reported by `Python` and/or `pip` during the build, try running the following first:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8 && \\\r\n  export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 && \\\r\n  export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 && \\\r\n  export LC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\" && \\\r\n  locale-gen en_US.UTF-8 && \\\r\n  sudo apt-get -y install language-pack-en-base && \\\r\n  sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/master/static/vultr.png)](http://www.vultr.com/?ref=6871746)\r\n\r\n(Netflix is **blocked**) The following is based on a Debian image provided by `Vultr`, but should in theory work on any Debian distribution. ~~Do **not** enable native IPv6 on the host.~~\r\n\r\n1.

The Python script `testbuild.py` is used to deploy and test `netflix-proxy`. This script deploys a test `Droplet` and then runs a serious of tests to verify (a) that all `Docker` containers start; (b) the `built.sh` script outputs the correct message at the end; (c) all the relevant services survive a reboot; and (d) proxy is able to comunicate with Netflix over SSL.\r\n\r\nThe `testbuild.py` script can also be used to programatically deploy `Droplets` from the command line:\r\n```\r\nusage: testbuild.py digitalocean [-h] --api_token API_TOKEN\r\n                                 [--client_ip CLIENT_IP]\r\n                                 [--fingerprint FINGERPRINT [FINGERPRINT ...]]\r\n                                 [--region REGION] [--branch BRANCH]\r\n                                 [--tb_user TB_USER] [--tb_passwd TB_PASSWD]\r\n                                 [--tb_key TB_KEY] [--tb_index TB_INDEX]\r\n                                 [--create] [--destroy] [--list_regions]\r\n                                 [--name NAME]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  --api_token API_TOKEN\r\n                        DigitalOcean API v2 secret token\r\n  --client_ip CLIENT_IP\r\n                        client IP to secure Droplet\r\n  --fingerprint FINGERPRINT [FINGERPRINT ...]\r\n                        SSH key fingerprint\r\n  --region REGION       region to deploy into; use --list_regions for a list\r\n  --branch BRANCH       netflix-proxy branch to deploy (default: master)\r\n  --tb_user TB_USER     HE tunnel broker username\r\n  --tb_passwd TB_PASSWD\r\n                        HE tunnel broker password\r\n  --tb_key TB_KEY       HE tunnel broker update key\r\n  --tb_index TB_INDEX   HE tunnel broker tunnel index (default: 1)\r\n  --create              Create droplet\r\n  --destroy             Destroy droplet\r\n  --list_regions        list all available regions\r\n  --name NAME           Droplet name\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, you will need a working `Python 2.7` environment and the modules listed in `tests/requirements.txt` (run `pip install -r tests/requirements.txt`).\r\n\r\n#### Test Video Playback\r\n\r\n##### Netflix\r\n\r\nAfter a successfull build deployment, `testvideo.py` is executed to test Netflix video playback. This is done by playing back 60 seconds of a title known to only be available in the US region (e.g. [1,000 Times Good Night](https://www.netflix.com/title/80001898)).\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: testvideo.py netflix [-h] --email EMAIL --password PASSWORD\r\n                            [--seconds SECONDS] [--titleid TITLEID]\r\n                            [--tries TRIES]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\r\n  --email EMAIL        Netflix username\r\n  --password PASSWORD  Netflix password\r\n  --seconds SECONDS    playback time per title in seconds (default: 60)\r\n  --titleid TITLEID    Netflix title_id to play (default: 80001898)\r\n  --tries TRIES        Playback restart attempts (default: 4)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA screenshot is saved at the end of the test and uploaded to the `gh-pages` branch.\r\n\r\n![Netflix VideoPlaybackTest screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/gh-pages/artifacts/VideoPlaybackTestNflx.png)\r\n\r\n##### Hulu\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `testvideo.py` is executed to test Hulu video playback using one of the free titles (e.g. [South Park S01E01: Cartman Gets an Anal Probe](http://www.hulu.com/watch/249837)). The build is configured not to fail in the event of Hulu test failing. This is because Hulu is almost cetrtainly blocked from Digital Ocean.\r\n\r\n![Hulu VideoPlaybackTest screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/gh-pages/artifacts/waitForPlayer.png)\r\n\r\n### IPv6 and Docker\r\nThis solution uses IPv6 downstream from the proxy to unblock IPv6 enabled providers, such as Netflix. No IPv6 support on the client is required for this to work, only the VPS must public IPv6 connectivity. You may also need to turn off IPv6 on your local network (and/or relevant devices).[n6] Having said that, the current iteration uses `HE Eectric's` free tunnel broker service to provide IPv6 connectivity, since `HE Electric` is geo-located in the US, Netflix geoblocking (or `geo-bollocking`, if you like), allows the traffic through.\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----------+                  +-----------+                 +-----------------+\r\n|          |                  |           |                 |                 |\r\n|  client  | +--------------> |   proxy   | +-------------> |  Netflix, etc.  |\r\n|          |      (ipv4)      |           |      (ipv6)     |                 |\r\n+----------+                  +-----------+                 +-----------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen IPv6 public address is present on the host, Docker is configured with public IPv6 support. This is done by assuming the smallest possible IPv6 allocation, dividing it further by two and assigning the second half to the Docker system. Network Discovery Protocol (NDP) proxying is required for this to work, since the second subnet can not be routed[n9]. Afterwards, Docker is running in dual-stack mode, with each container having a public IPv6 address. This approach seems to work in most cases where native IPv6 is used. If IPv6 is provided via a tunnel, Docker subnet can not be reliably calculated and must be specified using `-s` parameter to the `build.sh` script. If IPv6 is not enabled at all, the VPS is built with IPv4 support only.\r\n\r\n#### RamNode\r\nRamNode (and any other provider which uses SolusVM as its VPS provisioning system[n10]) assign a `/64` subnet to the VPS, but don't route it. Instead, individual addresses must be added in the portal if they are to be used on the host. After speaking with RamNode support, it appears this is a side-effect of MAC address filtering, which prevents IP address theft. This means that even though the subnet can be further divided on the host, only the main IPv6 address bound to `eth0` is ever accessible from the outside and none of the IPv6 addresses on the bridges below can communicate over IPv6 to the outside.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate this behavour, follow these steps:\r\n```\r\nIPV6_SUBNET=<allocated-ipv6-subnet> (e.g. 2604:180:2:abc)\r\nIPV6_ADDR=<allocated-ipv6-addr> (e.g. 2604:180:2:abc::abcd)\r\n\r\n# re-configure eth0\r\nip -6 addr del ${IPV6_ADDR}/64 dev eth0\r\nip -6 addr add ${IPV6_ADDR}/80 dev eth0\r\n\r\n# install Docker\r\napt-get update && apt-get -y install vim dnsutils curl sudo git && curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh\r\n\r\n# update DOCKER_OPTS\r\n# for upstart based systems (e.g. Ubuntu):\r\nprintf \"DOCKER_OPTS='--ipv6 --fixed-cidr-v6=\\\"${IPV6_SUBNET}:1::/80\\\"'\\n\" > /etc/default/docker && \\\r\n  service docker restart\r\n\r\n# -- OR --\r\n\r\n# for systemd based systems (e.g. Debian):\r\n# change \"ExecStart\" in /lib/systemd/system/docker.service to:\r\nExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd:// --ipv6 --fixed-cidr-v6=\"${IPV6_SUBNET}:1::/80\"\r\n\r\nsystemctl daemon-reload && \\\r\n  systemctl docker restart\r\n\r\n\r\n# verify IPv6 configuration inside Docker containers\r\ndocker run -it ubuntu:14.04 bash -c \"ip -6 addr show dev eth0; ip -6 route show\"\r\n\r\n# test (this will fail)\r\ndocker run -it ubuntu:14.04 bash -c \"ping6 google.com\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if we NAT all IPv6 traffic from this host using `eth0`, communication will be allowed:\r\n```\r\n# NAT all IPv6 traffic behind eth0\r\nip6tables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0  -j MASQUERADE\r\n\r\n# test (this will succeed)\r\ndocker run -it ubuntu:14.04 bash -c \"ping6 google.com\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Further Work\r\nThis solution is meant to be a quick and dirty (but functional) method of bypassing geo-restrictions for various services. While it is (at least in theory) called a `smart DNS proxy`, the only `smart` bit is in the `zones.override` file, which tells the system which domains to proxy and which to pass through. You could easilly turn this into a `dumb/transparent DNS proxy`, by replacing the contents of `zones.override` with a simple[n4] statement:\r\n\r\n    zone \".\" {\r\n        type master;\r\n        file \"/data/conf/db.override\";\r\n    };\r\n\r\nThis will in effect proxy every request that ends up on your VPS if you set your VPS IP as your main and only DNS server at home. This will unfortunately invalidate the original purpose of this project. Ideally, what you really want to do, is to have some form of DNS proxy at home, which selectively sends DNS requests to your VPS only for the domains you care about (i.e. netflix.com) and leaves everything else going out to your ISP DNS server(s). [Dnsmasq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq) could be used to achieve this, in combination, perhaps, with a small Linux device like Raspberry Pi or a router which can run OpenWRT.\r\n\r\nThere is a [similar](https://github.com/trick77/dockerflix) project to this, which automates the Dnsmasq configuration.\r\n\r\nIf your client is running OS X, you can skip dnsmasq and simply redirect all DNS requests for e.g. `netflix.com` to your VPS IP by creating a file at `/etc/resolver/netflix.com` with these contents:\r\n\r\n    nameserver xxx.yyy.zzz.ttt\r\n\r\nreplacing `xxx.yyy.zzz.ttt` with your VPS IP, of course.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nIf you have any idea, feel free to fork it and submit your changes back to me.\r\n\r\n### Donate\r\nIf you find this useful, please feel free to make a small donation with [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/belodetech) or Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n| Paypal | Bitcoin |\r\n| ------ | ------- |\r\n|<center>[![](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=5UUCDR8YXWERQ)</center>|<center>![91c446adbd54ef84eef1c6c1c723586aa0ba85d7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/master/static/bitcoin_qr.png)<br />91c446adbd54ef84eef1c6c1c723586aa0ba85d7</center>|\r\n\r\n### Petition\r\nIf you feel all of this is too complicated, I don't blame you.
